In the file /usr/sbin/captureWeathercamUpload

curl -T ${filename} ftp://upload1.weathercamnetwork.com.au/${cameraPi}.zip --user wcnetworkupload1:WeathercamNetwork123 --connect-timeout 30 --max-time 60

        wgetResult=$(wget -qO- "http://monitor.bsch.com.au/pi/download.and.unzip.php?cam=${cameraPi}&date=${currentTime}&uploadServer=upload1")
